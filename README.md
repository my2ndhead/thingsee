## Introduction
The Thingsee App for Splunk collects all Thingsee One metrics and presents them on dashboards.

## Installation

- Install Splunk >=6.2 

- Install Protocol Modular Input from  https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1901/ for HTTP Input (Custom cloud)
 or/and
- Install  MQTT Modular Input from https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1890/ for MQTT Api

- Install TA-thingsee from https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2853/
- Install Thingsee App from https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2854/
- Restart Splunk

- For custom cloud:
  - Login to Splunk and go to Setting -> Data inputs -> Protocol Data Inputs
  - Enable and/or adjust the thingsee input. By default, Splunk will listen to Port 8079/tcp 
  - Under Thingsee Creator, select your purpose, and enable the action to send events to the custom cloud URL. \
    e.g. http://mysplunkserver.com:8079

- For MQTT API:
  - Login to Splunk and go to Setting -> Data inputs -> MQTT
  - Edit Stanza thingsee_mqtt
  - To get the right credentials a REST call has to be made:
  - With your app.thingsee.com credentials, run:
        curl -X "POST" -H "Content-Type:application/json" \
        "http://api.thingsee.com/v2/accounts/login" \
        -d $'{"email": "<email>", "password": "<password>" }'

  - Use api.thingsee.com as the Broker Host
  - Use 1883 as the Broker Port
  - Use accountAuthUuid for Topic. The format is: /<accountAuthUuid>/events
  - Use accountAuthUuid as the Username
  - Use accountAuthToken as the Password
  - Save the form
  - Under Thingsee Creator, select your purpose, and enable the action to send events to the cloud
  - Copy the input for every thingsee device
  - Note: AuthTokens may expire from time to time. Currently you have to manually update them.

- Now you should see the dashboards filling up in the Splunk Thingsee App
- Happy Splunking !
